# MusicManager-App
Data Structures and Algorithms Music App Project

This is an application to manage your music collection. It has a home screen to facilitate all of the songs initially, but you then have the option to 'Like' a song by clicking the button with a heart on it. When a song is liked it goes to the 'Liked Songs' playlist, from which you can add the song to another playlist of your choice. If you want to remove a song from a playlist, there are buttons to do so. If the list gets too long, you can use the search bar to filter out the options, allowing you to find songs easier. The application is very easy to use and has a simple GUI.
